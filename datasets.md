# üìö Datasets Used in Dynamic Pruning Project

This repository uses the following well-known image classification datasets to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the dynamic pruning technique:

## 1. üñºÔ∏è CIFAR-10
- **Description:** RGB images of size 32√ó32 pixels from 10 object categories.
- **Categories:** Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, Truck.
- **Total Images:** 60,000 (50,000 training + 10,000 test images).
- **Purpose in Project:** Evaluating performance at 80% sparsity.

## 2. ‚úèÔ∏è MNIST
- **Description:** Grayscale images (28√ó28 pixels, resized to 32√ó32) of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.
- **Total Images:** 70,000 (60,000 training + 10,000 test images).
- **Purpose in Project:** Evaluating performance at 77% sparsity.
