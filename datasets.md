# üìö Datasets Used in Dynamic Pruning Project

This project evaluates dynamic pruning techniques using two widely recognized benchmark datasets:

## 1. üñºÔ∏è CIFAR-10
- **Description:** RGB images (32√ó32 pixels) from 10 object categories.
- **Categories:** Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, Truck.
- **Total Images:** 60,000 (50,000 training + 10,000 test images)
- **Purpose in Project:** Evaluating accuracy and sparsity performance (up to 80% sparsity).

## 2. ‚úèÔ∏è MNIST
- **Description:** Grayscale images (28√ó28 pixels resized to 32√ó32) of handwritten digits (0‚Äì9).
- **Total Images:** 70,000 (60,000 training + 10,000 test images)
- **Purpose in Project:** Evaluating accuracy and sparsity performance (up to 77% sparsity).

*Both datasets are popular benchmarks extensively used in image classification research.*
